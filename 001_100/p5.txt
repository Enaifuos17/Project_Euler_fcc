The code defines two functions: 
lcm(a, b) and gcd(a, b), 
which are used to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) and 
greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, respectively. 
These functions will be used later in the smallestMult(n) function.

The gcd(a, b) function uses the Euclidean recursive algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. 
The algorithm works as follows:

a. If the second number (b) is equal to 0, 
it means that the first number (a) is the GCD, 
and the function returns a.

b. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments (b, a % b), 
where % is the modulo operator, 
which gives the remainder of the division of a by b. 
This continues until b becomes 0.

The lcm(a, b) function calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula: 
LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). 
It calls the gcd(a, b) function to get the GCD of a and b and then uses it to compute the LCM.

The smallestMult(n) function takes a single parameter n, 
which represents the range of numbers from 1 to n. 
The goal of this function is to find the smallest multiple, 
that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n.

The function initializes a variable maxLCM to 1. 
This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum LCM found so far.

It uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to n, inclusive. 
It starts from 2 because the LCM of any number with 1 is itself, 
so there's no need to calculate it.

Inside the loop, for each number i, it updates the maxLCM by calling the lcm(maxLCM, i) function. 
This ensures that maxLCM always contains the LCM of all numbers from 1 to i.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of maxLCM, 
which represents the smallest multiple that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n.

For example: 
if you call smallestMult(10), 
it will find the smallest multiple that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to 10, 
which is 2520.
